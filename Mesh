what is the difference between meshCA and IstioCA?

This is a key choice when installing Cloud Service Mesh (ASM). The main difference is where the Certificate Authority runs and who manages it.

Mesh CA (--ca mesh_ca): This is a Google-managed, hosted CA service that runs on Google Cloud. Your cluster communicates with this Google service to get certificates.

Istio CA (--ca citadel): This is the in-cluster, self-managed CA that comes with open-source Istio. It runs as a pod (part of istiod) inside your own Kubernetes cluster.

Comparison Table:
  Feature	Mesh CA (Google-managed)	                                      Istio CA (Citadel, in-cluster)
  Location	[Mesh CA]Runs on Google Cloud (outside your cluster)	        [Istio CA (Citadel, in-cluster)]Runs inside your Kubernetes cluster (as part of istiod)
  Management	[Mesh CA]Google-managed. Google handles availability, security, and rotation of the root CA.	
              [Istio CA (Citadel, in-cluster)]You-managed. You are responsible for its availability (it's a pod) and the security of its keys.

  asmcli Flag	(Mesh CA) --ca mesh_ca	                                    [Istio CA (Citadel, in-cluster)]--ca citadel
  Connectivity	(Mesh CA)Requires network access to mesh.googleapis.com.	[Istio CA (Citadel, in-cluster)]No external dependencies. Works in fully air-gapped environments.

Why Choose One Over the Other?
1. Mesh CA (--ca mesh_ca)
You choose this when you want a highly-available, zero-maintenance CA for your service mesh.

Pro: You don't have to worry about managing, backing up, or securing the CA's private keys. Google does it for you.

Pro: It provides a single, consistent root of trust across a multi-cluster mesh (e.g., GKE, on-prem, and other clouds) that are all part of the same Google Fleet.

Con: It creates a dependency on Google Cloud. It will not work if your cluster is in a fully air-gapped network with no access to Google APIs.

2. Istio CA (--ca citadel)
You choose this when you need full control and data sovereignty, or when your cluster is air-gapped.

Pro: It runs entirely within your cluster. No external dependencies are needed for it to sign certificates.

Pro: This is the standard, open-source Istio behavior.

Con: You are fully responsible for its security and lifecycle. If the istiod pod crashes, new workloads can't get certificates.

Con: This is what you were doing in your last command: you had to manually generate and provide the root and intermediate certificates (--ca_cert, --ca_key, etc.) for Istio CA to use. With Mesh CA, you provide none of those files.
